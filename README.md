# Welcome to Coffe-Commerce!

A web application must be implemented that manages information by storing and retrieving it from a Relational Database. A real assumption will be thought of, it will be written and the web application will be created to manage it.
The real assumption that is prepared as a project must contain at least 4 elements from which information is stored (which would be equivalent to 4 entities in the Entity/Relationship model). Each of the entities must have at least 4 attributes of its own.
A series of mandatory requirements are proposed that must be implemented and another series of functionalities from which you can choose to complete the note.
All the development of the project will be carried out using the Git Flow methodology, using branches for each of the functionalities that are implemented and using the GitHub Issues manager to register and manage the different incidents.
In addition, there will be an exhaustive monitoring of the tasks (assigning the tasks to the component of the group that is in charge of them) carried out by each component of the group using Trello (https://www.trello.com).


# Requirements

✔️**Database**: Design the Entity-Relationship model, prepare the relational model and write the SQL script that will create the table structure that will form the project database.

✔️**UML**: Design the use case diagram (complete, as if you were going to implement all the proposed functionalities), class diagram and the sequence diagram of a functionality that you decide.

✔️**Git**: Create a repository on GitHub and manage the development of the project using the Git Flow methodology and registering/managing the incidents found in the GitHub issue manager.

✔️**Functionality** (List and detail): The web application must list the content of a couple of tables and display the details of each record when they are clicked. It must be laid out using HTML + CSS to correctly present the content.

✔️**Functionality** (Registration and Deletion): It will be possible to register and delete information from a couple of tables (also layout with HTML + CSS) through a form.

✔️**Functionality** (modify): You can modify the information of any element from its detail view.

**Functionality** (search): Modifies the web so that users can carry out some type of search or filtering on the data lists.

✔️**Functionality** (relationships): Implement functionalities on the web that allow establishing relationships between data from different tables.

✔️**Functionality** (Javascript): Uses Ajax to execute an action asynchronously, such as registering, deleting or modifying an element of it.

**Functionality** (Pagination): When displaying the listings, it implements some form of pagination when these listings exceed a set limit.

✔️**Deployment**: The web application will be deployed in the space that each group has reserved on an AWS server.

✔️**Continuous Integration**: Prepare and configure a job in Jenkins to build the project and launch a code analysis to a SonarQube.

✔️**English**: Translates all the texts of the web application so that it is completely displayed in English.
